## Installation

This is a demo application using the Mist APIs.

You can run it as a strandalone Python application, or deploy it as a Docker container.

**Note**: The application is not providing secured HTTPS connections. It is highly recommended to deploy it behind a reverse proxy providing HTTPS encryption.

### Standalone deployment
1. download the github repository
2. from the project folder, install the python dependencies (ex: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`)
3. create a `config.py` file in the directory `django/backend/` with the required settings. A configuration example with explanation is avaiable in  `django/backend/config_example.py`. 
4. from the `django_app`folder, start the app with `python3 ./manage.py runserver` (please see Djano server options with `python3 ./manage.py runserver -h`)

### Docker Image
The docker image is available on docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/tmunzer/mist_psk.


The Docket image is listening on port TCP8000
